# PSR Image Enhancer :

This project was shortlisted for the **Smart India Hackathon**. It focuses on enhancing the visibility of **Permanently Shadowed Regions (PSRs)** on the Moon using image processing techniques.

##  Problem Statement : 
PSRs are areas that never receive sunlight, making them difficult to study using traditional images. Our goal is to simulate illumination and reveal hidden features using virtual enhancement.

##  Tech Stack : 
- Python
- OpenCV
- Image Processing
- Gradient Simulation

##  Key Features : 
- Detection of black regions (PSRs) in satellite or cosmic images
- Application of custom gradient fills to simulate lighting
- Real-time image processing with visual comparisons
- Designed for potential use in **X-ray, cosmic, and lunar image analysis**

##  Achievement : 
- Selected from college for **Smart India Hackathon 2023**

##  Future Scope : 
- Integrate with AI models to enhance crater structure prediction
- Support other planetary datasets (Mars, Mercury, etc.)
